    CodedTool implementation which adds an agent to the agent network definition in the sly data.

    Agent network definition is a structured representation of an agent network, expressed as a dictionary.
    Each key is an agent name, and its value is an object containing:
    - a description of the agent
    - an instructions to the agent
    - a list of down-chain agents (agents reporting to it)

        :param args: An argument dictionary whose keys are the parameters
                to the coded tool and whose values are the values passed for them
                by the calling agent.  This dictionary is to be treated as read-only.

                The argument dictionary expects the following keys:
                    "agent_name": the name of the agent to add.
                    "is_tool": whether the agent is a tool or not.

        :param sly_data: A dictionary whose keys are defined by the agent hierarchy,
                but whose values are meant to be kept out of the chat stream.

                This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
                It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
                yet exist as a bulletin board, as long as the responsibility
                for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood
                by the agent chain implementation and the coded_tool implementation
                adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.

                Keys expected for this implementation are:
                    "agent_network_definition": an outline of an agent network
